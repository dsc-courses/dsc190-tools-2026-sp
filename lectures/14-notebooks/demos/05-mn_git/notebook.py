    # marimo notebooks are Python files

    Open this notebook file (`notebook.py`) in any plain text editor, and you'll see ordinary Python (with some `marimo` syntactic sugar). This is in contrast with Jupyter notebooks (which as JSON). As a consequence, Marimo notebooks are easier to version control.

    The plot above depends on the current time, so the picture changes every time the cell runs. But the notebook file is unchanged — the plot output lives only in the marimo UI, not in `notebook.py`.

    Try it:

    1. Commit this file to git as-is.
    2. Open the notebook in marimo and let it run.
    3. Run `git diff notebook.py` in a terminal.

    The diff is empty. The plot rendered, but nothing about the file changed. Contrast this with the Jupyter `noisy_diffs.ipynb` demo, where the same operation produced a massive diff full of base64.
